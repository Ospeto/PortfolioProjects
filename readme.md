### Approach

#### Data Processing:

Applied EDA, Data Cleaning, and Data Analysis methods to understand and clean the dataset.
Utilized tools taught by Google's instructors for effective data visualization.

#### Machine Learning Models:
Implemented Logistic Classification and XGBoost models for Binary Classification.
Prediction focused on determining if an employee will stay or leave based on various features like working hours, satisfaction level, and tenure.
Emphasized achieving a higher precision score during model tuning.

#### Model Performance:
XGBoost model demonstrated precision, f1, accuracy, and recall scores of approximately 90%, indicating reliable predictions.
Conducted feature engineering for a more realistic representation of scenarios.

#### Final Model:
Tweaked features to enhance model accuracy without overfitting.
The resulting model performs well, providing accurate predictions for employee retention.
Notable Achievements
Successful implementation of logistic regression and XGBoost models.
Precision-focused approach for accurate identification of potential employee departures.
Final model showcases both high performance and resilience against overfitting.
